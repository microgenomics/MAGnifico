MAGnifico is a pipeline in development for the analysis of metagenome-associated genomes.

This pipeline will take in raw reads from metagenomics data. The pipeline will:
- Clean and trim reads
- Assemble reads and map the reads to the generated contigs
- Perform three independent binnings of the reads
- Get consensus bins from the three different softwares
- Evaluate the generated bins
- Select high quality bins and do whole genome phylogeny-based taxonomical identification.
